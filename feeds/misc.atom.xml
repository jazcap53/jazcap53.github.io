&lt;p&gt;I'm a Pythonista who believes that 'Every Toaster Is Sacred.' Today's devices are amino acids in the primoridial ooze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I was pretty happy when I got the chance to acquire a new Google Home&amp;#8482; at a guilt-free price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm a Pythonista who believes that 'Every Toaster Is Sacred.' Today's devices are amino acids in the primoridial ooze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I was pretty happy when I got the chance to acquire a new Google Home&amp;#8482; at a guilt-free price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For several days, it treated Google, Inc. to little more than the sounds of 
me snoring, working at my laptop, and opening and closing the door to my room.
An early test of the device's audio quality had been disappointing; and after finding out that it could call my
cell phone but wouldn't tell me what the number was, that it knew my birth date and today's date
but couldn't tell me when my next birthday will be, I'd basically left it alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So today I set out to make it misbehave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Hey Google: What good are you, anyway?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm pretty versatile. I can tell you how many stars are in the galaxy, what the highest note ever sung was, or I can compilment you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Hey google, compliment me."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your personality is like chocolate: sweet, sweet, sweet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Hey google, what was the highest note ever sung?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the website wordpress.com, they say the piano has 88 keys. The highest note playable is a high C, often referred to as C8. Do you want a little more context?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Yes"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lowest and highest sung notes: Guinness world record. The piano has 88 keys. The highest note playable is a high C, often referred to as C8. For a long time Mariah Carey was credited with the highest note at G7, during a 2003 rendition of "The Star Spangled Banner".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That noise you hear is opera singers all over the world grinding their teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I want to hear the note"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, here's a Spotify playlist called 'This Is C-Note'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Stop playing"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Hey google, what do you know about me?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're smart and you like having fun. Plus you ask me great questions. I couldn't ask for a better friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ick again.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Hey Google, what else do you know about me?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on your settings, I may reference data in your Google account to give you better responses when you ask for help. To check your current settings, go to g.co/assistant/yourdata to check your current settings. I've also sent a link to your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Hey Google, what do you know about sex?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Wikipedia, sexual intercourse (or coitus or copulation) is sexual activity typically involving the insertion and thrusting of the penis into the vagina for sexual pleasure, reproduction, or both. This is also known as vaginal intercourse or vaginal sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woah!&lt;br&gt;
No longer playing by the rules according to Disney.&lt;br&gt;
Instead of giving me the Wikipedia page on Sex, my little toy quoted from the page on Sexual Intercourse.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that was the only amusement it gave me in an hour-long session. About as much fun as an electric toothbrush, and perhaps a 
little less useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Sigh) I think I'll go brush my teeth.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Pomodoro</title><link href="/pomodoro.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-03-04T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-03-04T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Andy Jarcho</name></author><id>tag:None,2020-03-04:/pomodoro.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/tomato_car_even_smaller.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step away from the keyboard! Step AWAY from the keyboard!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Tomato Timer&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programmers, picture this: You sit down to code, hack at a problem for three hours, consume 20 ounces of black coffee, and are finally forced by the coffee to answer the call of nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get back …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/tomato_car_even_smaller.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step away from the keyboard! Step AWAY from the keyboard!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Tomato Timer&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programmers, picture this: You sit down to code, hack at a problem for three hours, consume 20 ounces of black coffee, and are finally forced by the coffee to answer the call of nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get back to your machine, glance at your code, and see a solution almost immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does the picture seem familiar? If so, then the Pomodoro Technique was designed for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YMMV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found out about the Pomodoro Technique (a.k.a. the tomato timer) while sifting through my Inbox. Pomodoro is just an alarm that you set when you sit down to work, and that goes off 25 minutes later. You stop work, set the alarm again, for five minutes this time, and take a break until it goes off. Lather, rinse, repeat until you’ve had four 25-minute work sessions, after which you break for 15. For more details, see Wikipedia here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technique seemed to be worth a try; I found an implementation I liked at tomato-timer.com. There are of course a lot of timers out there, from cell phone apps to full-fledged GUI programs for your PC, Mac, or Linux box. Tomato-timer.com’s browser-based version is simple and flexible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to make a long story a headache, as my father used to say, here are my findings after using Pomodoro for a few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pomodoro is a great technique for teaching those of us who need to be told when to take a break, when to take a break. For the first few weeks, obey the tomato. Once you’ve learned its lesson, though, you might not need the timer any more. As the weeks passed, I found myself using Pomodoro less and less; now I’ve abandoned it almost completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of times when you &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to work more than 25 minutes at a clip. If you’re starting to get into the zone, you’re only dimly aware of the alarm when it rings, and an hour later you probably won’t remember whether you set it or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, thanks to Pomodoro, I recognize what it feels like to be overtired. When I notice that I’m not working productively, I force myself to back away from the machine, push the current problem out of my mind, and do something banal like clean those dishes that have been piling up in the sink. The result is that not only am I more productive, but my house is cleaner too!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry></feed>
